# Nightscout-600-Series-Uploader-with-Connect-iQ-SDK
This is a modified version of the pazaans Nightscout uploader, found here: https://github.com/pazaan/600SeriesAndroidUploader.

It works for MiniMed 600 Series insulin pumps using a Contour Next Link 2.4 blood glucose meter.

This projects aim is to implement communication between this application and Garmin devices running a Connect iQ datafield, enabling blood glucose values to be logged along with other activity data. 

Note:
1. Beta version of Connect iQ datafield is comming soon
2. Code works with Connect iQ simulator in Eclipse, but unfortunately not with a real device. Any help troubleshooting is appreciated.
